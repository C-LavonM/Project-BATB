<h2>All about Beauty (Catherine) </h2>

<!--Catherine backstory-->
<p class="cat">Catherine grew up in Westchester with her parents, Thomas & Vanessa Chandler, and her younger sister, Heather. She graduated from Fenton High School in 2003, and attended Princeton, planning to become a lawyer like Thomas.

    While attending Princeton, she got a job as a bartender at the Salty Dawg in order to pay for tuition. On her first night, she had car trouble after closing up and called her mother for help. After Vanessa arrived to assist her daughter, two men showed up and gunned down Vanessa in front of Catherine. When they tried to kill Catherine, she ran into the woods but tripped and fell. Suddenly, the two gunmen were attacked by what Catherine described as a "beast." No one believed her, though, and she eventually came to believe that she was so traumatized she'd misunderstood what happened.
    
    Catherine graduated from Princeton, magna cum laude, and later graduated from the police academy with high marks. She worked her way up through the ranks to become a homicide detective at the 125th precinct.</p>

<h2>All about the Beast (Vincent)</h2>

<!--Vincent backstory-->
<p class="vince"> He grew up in Astoria, Queens with two older brothers, William & Daniel, and two childhood friends, Alex Salter and J.T. Forbes. Vincent, Alex, and J.T all remained friends well into adulthood. Vincent and J.T were even roommates in medical school. Alex and Vincent's relationship became romantic, and they got engaged. However, after the death of Vincent's brothers in the twin tower attacks in 2001, Vincent gave up his medical career to join the army and ended his engagement to Alex.

    Military Career
        
    Vincent enlisted in the army in late 2001. When he arrives in Afghanistan, he gets tapped to join a project called Operation Muirfield. He was told that he was being injected with antibiotics, vitamins, and steroids that would protect him, when in fact, he was being injected with a serum designed to trigger rapid genetic mutation. This made him "stronger, faster, better." Moreover, they heightened his reflexes and all his senses. However, there were some unforeseen consequences when his adrenaline started running high, he turns into a terrifying beast, unable to control his aggression.
    
    When the experiments started running awry, becoming destructive and unstoppable, they decided to shut down Muirfield and gave orders to eradicate all the soldiers who became experiments, along with any trace that Muirfield ever existed. Vincent manages to survive the attack executed to kill his unit. The military reports him killed by enemy fire in Afghanistan.
    
    Missing years
    
    Vincent came back to New York, where he reconnected with J.T., who hid him from Muirfield and the public eye. Vincent went into a self-imposed isolation, cutting off all contact from the outside world. He and J.T. worked to find a cure for his condition, but after multiple failures, Vincent gave up.
    
    In 2003, when Muirfield agents killed Vanessa Chandler, Vincent saved her daughter, Catherine, from being killed as well because she witnessed the murder. After this, Vincent kept an eye on Catherine from a distance, making sure she was safe. From time to time, he also saved other people who were being attacked or harmed, becoming known as a vigilante.</p>

<h2>JT</h2>

<!--JT backstory-->
<p class="jt">J.T. and Vincent grew up together. They were roommates while Vincent was a medical resident. While Vincent enlisted in the army, J.T. became a medical researcher and college professor. After Vincent survived being exterminated by Muirfield while in Afghanistan, he re-connected with J.T. after coming back to New York. J.T. helped keep him hidden from Muirfield and the public, and also researched Vincent's cross-species DNA in an attempt to help Vincent find an antidote.J.T. likes to run jokes and is a very sarcastic person. However, he tends to speak a bit more sarcastically with Catherine than with anyone else. This is because his fear of Muirfield finding him and Vincent and his own overprotective nature often pits him against Catherine, who he sees as a danger to himself and Vincent.</p>

<h2>Tess</h2>

<!--Tess backstory-->
<p class="tess">Tess is best friend of Catherine has five brothers, all of whom are police officers. She once had to partner with Detective Wolansky for two years before partnering with Catherine. Tess is a very forgiving, easygoing person. However, she can also be very sarcastic, direct, and outspoken, especially when dealing with criminals and suspects. Tess had a secret affair with Joe, which might have stemmed from low self-esteem in the dating department. She is now dating J.T. Forbes.</p>

<h2 class="heather">Heather</h2>
<img src="./Video/heath.JPG" alt=" photo of Heather">
<!--Heather backstory-->
<p>Heather is bubbly, carefree, and fun-loving little sister of Catherine. She often looks to lighten up situations and show a bright side to something sad. Though this often makes people happy, it also makes Heather seem superficial. She means well, but can come across as overbearing. Heather herself admits that she can be judgmental, as she sometimes doesn't understand the seriousness of a situation. She tries not to make a bad situation worse by not getting involved or trying to deflect the issue, often in hopes to keeping others happy, but this makes her emotionally fragile at times. Heather cares about her family, and tries to not let the loss of both her parents effect her as much as it does; this also makes her try harder to stay close to Catherine, her only remaining family.</p>
